# NATO-shortcut
A userscript to add a link directly to the New Answers To Old questions next to the Tools link in the queues dropdown in Stack Overflow.

This userscript is meant to save one click and a little bit of waiting. Instead of going to the (10k) Tools and waiting for the page to load while you chase the NATO link that's running away - simply install this script and a direct link to the NATO tool will be added next to Tools:
